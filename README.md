GitHub User Search for Udhaar Book Pvt Ltd
Description:
This project sets up a React and Redux application to interact with the GitHub API. The goal is to create a simple interface where users can search for GitHub users and view their basic information, as well as detailed information in a modal.

Installation:
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm:
Copy code
npm install
Usage:
Run the development server:
arduino
Copy code
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
You can search for GitHub users using the search input.
Clicking on a user's name will open a modal displaying detailed information about the user.
Exercise:
The task is to create a React application using ES6 and Redux. Here's a breakdown of the required components:

Input component for search: Handles user input for searching GitHub users.
List component: Displays a list of GitHub users.
Item component: Represents each item in the user list, showing the user's picture, name (login), and a link to their GitHub profile.
Modal component: Displays detailed information about a user upon clicking their name. Includes the number of followers, following, picture, location, and full name. The modal has a close button and a backdrop to close it.
Requirements:
Utilize React, Redux, and ES6 for the application.
Implement separate folders for each component, making them independent.
Create a service to handle GitHub API calls.
Implement debounce functionality on the search input to avoid excessive API requests.
Notes:
Third-party libraries can be installed for modal functionality and API calls.
